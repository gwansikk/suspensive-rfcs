# Suspensive RFCs

## Inspiration

Suspensive's RFC process owes its inspiration to the [Yarn RFC process], [Rust RFC process], and [Ember RFC process].

We've changed it in the past in response to feedback, and we're open to changing it again if needed.

[Rust RFC process]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs
[Ember RFC process]: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs
